#3. Exercise 3 

##The database

We need to design a database for our tasks.

You will need to keep a record all task orders. A task can
have

  1. task_id
  2. task_name
  3. task_desc
  4. completed
  5. task_time_start
  6. task_time_end
  7. task_created

## Part 1
Design and draw out your ERDs. Make sure to note all of your datatypes, PKs, FKs, indices, etc.

## Part 2
Create that table.

## Part 3
Create a `/db/schema.sql` file which will be used to create all the tables
in your database.

## Part 4
Create a `/db/seed.sql` that will seed your database with some dummy tasks for testing.
_Note_: Don't forget about dropping the table if it exists

## Part 5
Test and validate that your DB is working as expected.
