### Learning Objectives
 - [ ] Decompose a static HTML design layout into static React components
 - [ ] Investigate the difference between Stateful React Classes and Stateless React Functions
 - [ ] Construct application dependencies for webpack compilation
   

###Step 1. Start Ye Some React (Partner Time!)

**Find a partner with whom you have not yet worked**

We need to plan our React components. React components come in two major varieties: 
  1. Full React Class-based components that represent _state_.
  2. Light-weight Function-based components that receive _props_, **but no state**. 

Open `starter_resources/layout.html` in your favorite browser. 
  1. Diagram the major parts of the application. 
  2. What are the smallest functioning parts of this layout we can represent?
  3. Identify items that are repeated. Can these items be created in the abstract and reused in many places?
  4. Your application should only have one central source of truth: **the state**. How will you represent the state of the tasks?
  5. What's the main difference between the lists? Can this be generalized?
  6. BONUS: How does the state of the database correlate with the state of the application?

### Step 2 
Let's start creating our first React components. We'll need the proper folder layout that our compiler is expecting:

```
/src
└── client
    ├── app
    │   ├── App.jsx
    │   └── main.jsx
    ├── css
    │   └── styles.css
    └── helpers
        └── util.js
```

  1. `/src/client/app` is where your application will live. 
  2. Webpack will start looking at `/src/client/app/main.jsx` to begin the compilation. 
  2. `App.jsx` is the 'root' of your React application
  3. Copy `starter_resources/styles.css` into `/src/client/css`
  3. Create a blank file `/src/client/helpers/util.js` (git ignores empty folders)


### Step 3

In `main.jsx`, we need to make some declarations about which files/assets we'll need in our project. These should be pretty self-explanatory. _(note that the `import` syntax is part of es6's package management feature, while `require` is npm's)_

```
import App from './App.jsx';
require('bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css');
require('../css/styles.css')
```

We'll need to create a wrapper for our _stateful_ core component that uses React. **We'll be using es6 _class_ syntax to build our components.** 

####Inside `App.jsx` 
```
// import the libs we need
import React            from 'react';
import ReactDOM         from 'react-dom'

// create a React Component called _App_
export default class App extends React.Component{

    // note that es6 classes do **not** have commas between their methods

    // 90% of your components will render()
    // REMEMBER you can only return **one** root element from a render fn.
    render(){
        return(
            <container>
                <header>
                    <p>Hello world example</p>
                </header>
                <div className="container">
                    <div className="row">
                    {/*everything goes in here*/}
                    </div>
                </div>
            </container>
        )
    }
}

// mount our App at #container
ReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.querySelector('#container'))
```

**NOTE** Certain HTML attributes interfere with React. As such, we cannot use `class=` or `for=`, instead use `className=` and `htmlFor=` respectively.

### Step 4 The easy parts
Let's convert some of the easiest parts of the site into React.

The most trivial part of the website is the navigation bar. The nav bar doesn't and shouldn't have a concept of _state_; it doesn't need to react to changes in state. 

Let's create the Nav component as a _stateless function_: `/src/client/app/Nav.jsx`.

```
import React from 'react';

export default function Nav(props){
  return 
  <nav>
    {/* slice out the nav from the layout template.*/}
  </nav>
}
``` 

Make sure to import this new component in `App.jsx`!

###Step 5 The Rest

Repeat the steps above to build out the `Footer`, the `TaskForm` and `TaskList`.
**Protip** Only the `App` should be a class with state, all the other components should be stateless functional components that accept `props`.
